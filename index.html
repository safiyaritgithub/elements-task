  <h1>Semantic html</h1>
  <p>Accessibility: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of web content. This allows users with disabilities to navigate websites more easily. For example, using nav, header, main, and footer elements clearly defines the different sections of a webpage, aiding users in understanding its layout and organization.</p>
  <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on semantic HTML to better understand the content and context of web pages. Using appropriate semantic elements can improve search engine rankings by providing search engines with more relevant information about the page. For instance, using article, section, and h1 to h6 elements appropriately can help search engines identify the main content and its hierarchical structure</p>
<h2>Examples of Semantic Elements</h2>
<p>header: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or webpage. It typically contains navigation links, logos, and headings.</p>
<p>nav: Defines a section of navigation links.</p>
<p>article: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.</p>
<h2>Examples of non-semantic HTML elements:</h2>
<p>div: A generic container used for styling and layout purposes. While div elements are versatile, they don't provide any semantic meaning on their own.</p>
<p>span: Used for applying inline styles or scripting, but it doesn't convey any semantic meaning by itself.</p>
